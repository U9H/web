**If you're looking to become a better designer, or want to know what makes some apps great, understanding UI & UX in depth is essential.**  

While both fields relate, individual practice and thought are still necessary.

# What is design?

Before we get into how UI & UX differ, it's important to have a grasp on the definition of design.  Most folks say that design "makes things look pretty".  My definition is a bit more all-encompassing.

Design is everything.  I know that answer is a cop-out, but stay with me.  Design is any structure that conveys meaning or purpose to a user.  Websites have design, furniture has design, software has design, and even [languages have design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban).

In this story, we're concerned with **visual design**.  Visual design explores human sight, perception, and psychology.  Product design, web design, graphic design, and interior design are all examples of visual design.  As it so happens, UI & UX are on that list too.

## What is UI and UX Design?

User interface (UI) design includes topics like colors, typography, and spacing.  This is the "pretty" part.

User experience (UX) design is the way our product functions.  UX helps us guide users in various tasks such as signing up for a newsletter or navigating to a specific page.  It is more about how something *functions* instead of how something *looks*. 

Today, we're focusing on the most common applications of UI/UX design.  This includes desktop applications or websites.  However, UI/UX isn't limited to this space and has applications in many diverse fields.

# In-depth: User Interface

User interface (UI) design is the application of design rules to interactive or informational elements.  It defines how interfaces look through usage of colors, spacing, typography, and more.  There are a few key reasons why UI design is so important:

## It helps users know where to look first

Newspapers contain a ton of words, images, and advertisements.  Yet readers still navigate them with ease.  How is that possible?  Consider the following examples.  Which is easier to parse?

You likely chose the second image, but why is that?  Limited to text elements, font size groups content into easier chunks.  This is an aspect of **hierarchy**.  Hierarchy in design dictates what viewers see first.

Hierarchy is not limited to sizing.  It involves anything that makes an element stand out.  We can use color, spacing, and font to denote hierarchical elements.

Hierarchy is present everywhere - not only print media.  This site uses *spacing*, *font*, and *sizes* to split up elements.

## It helps users understand what to tap or click

Whenever you use an app on your phone, you're making decisions.   "Should I make this post public? Should I get the 2-day shipping? Should I comment on this website?"  Visual design gives you you cues on what decisions to make, and how to interact with interfaces.

Imagine you're creating a website, and you want to link to your friend's blog.  How should that link look?  You use plain text that says "Look at this blog!" in your first iteration.

This isn't working, but why?  It's because users expect interactive elements to share specific visual aspects.  In your case, a simple underline will denote a hyperlink.  These expectations are examples of [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) (which also deserve their own story).

Buttons are rectangles with text.  Links have underlines.  Text inputs have labels.   Applying expected visual styles to interfaces allows us to show behavior without explanation.   This doesn't mean we can't experiment.  But having structure helps us to build unique interfaces with clarity.

There is much, much more to UI design, and it deserves its own story.  These examples mean to give an idea of UI's importance.

# In-depth: User Experience

User experience (UX) design focuses on how users interact with something.  Think of UX as creating a story-line for users to follow.  When designing an application with UX in mind, user goals must be considered.    

For instance, assume you are designing a web store, and you want to guide a user through checkouts.  You want the *flow* of those interactions to be as easy as possible so that nobody gets frustrated.  You would make the user go through logical steps:

```

login page -> click add to cart button -> checkout page -> sale complete

``` 

You could even shorten this process and add a simple "buy now" button like Amazon.

```

login page -> buy now!

```

These examples are very simplistic examples of **user journeys**.  User journeys illustrate what steps users go through to accomplish a task, and are a fundamental aspect of UX design.

Note that none of the examples included anything but text.  That's because UI covers visual design, while UX covers the base interactions.  This is a simplification, but it generally holds true.

# Ideas used for UX design with examples

User experience design involves many different processes.

## Personas

Think of personas as potential users.  For instance, if you're making a banking app, you could have personas like these:

1. Maria.   She's 18 and looking for a way to keep track of her finances.  She still lives with her parent, and doesn't have a job.  She wants a way to check that she has enough money to go out with friends, and make sure she isn't overspending.

2. Johnathan.  He's 46 and married with 2 children.  He is paying off a house and has trouble remembering to pay his mortgage on time.

3. Jules.  They're 24 and single with a full-time job.  They're saving up for a house and need help keeping track of expenses.

All three users are using the same application, but have different goals.  Maria might want a spending tracking feature.  Johnathan might want an auto-pay feature.  Jules might want a gamified savings account.  

Personas help us design around **user goals**.  It's a part of [user-centered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design) design, and an essential part of UX design.

## User testing

While personas can help in understanding, there's always more to learn.  User testing lets designers directly connect with users.
