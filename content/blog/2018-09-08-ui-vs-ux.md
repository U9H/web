**If you're looking to become a better designer, or want to know what makes some apps great, understanding UI & UX in depth is essential.**  

While both fields relate, individual practice and thought are still necessary.

# What is design?

Before we get into how UI & UX differ, it's important to have a grasp on the definition of design.  Most folks say that design "makes things look pretty".  My definition is a bit more all-encompassing.

Design is everything.  I know that answer is a cop-out, but stay with me.  Design is any structure that conveys meaning or purpose to a user.  Websites have design, furniture has design, software has design, and even [languages have design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban).

In this story, we're concerned with **visual design**.  Visual design explores human sight, perception, and psychology.  Product design, web design, graphic design, and interior design are all examples of visual design.  As it so happens, UI & UX are on that list too.

## What is UI and UX Design?

User interface (UI) design includes topics like colors, typography, and spacing.  This is the "pretty" part.

User experience (UX) design is the way our product functions.  UX helps us guide users in various tasks such as signing up for a newsletter or navigating to a specific page.  

Today, we're focusing on the most common applications of UI/UX design.  This includes desktop applications or websites.  However, UI/UX isn't limited to this space and has applications in many diverse fields.

# In-depth: User Interface

User interface (UI) design is the application of design rules to interactive or informational elements.  It defines how interfaces look through usage of colors, spacing, typography, and more.  There are a few key reasons why UI design is so important:

## It helps users know where to look first

Newspapers contain a ton of words, images, and advertisements.  Yet readers still navigate them with ease.  How is that possible?  Consider the following examples.  Which is easier to parse?

You likely chose the second image, but why is that?  Limited to text elements, font size groups content into easier chunks.  This is an aspect of **hierarchy**.  Hierarchy in design dictates what viewers see first.

Hierarchy is not limited to sizing.  It involves anything that makes an element stand out.  We can use color, spacing, and font to denote hierarchical elements.

Hierarchy is present everywhere - not only print media.  This site uses *spacing*, *font*, and *sizes* to split up elements.

## It helps users understand what to tap or click

## It helps users access information  

There is much, much more to UI design, and it deserves it's own story.  But these examples likely give a framework for UI's importance.
