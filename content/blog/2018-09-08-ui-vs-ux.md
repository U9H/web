Whether you're a beginner to the design world, or you just want to know more about what makes a good application, understanding the differences between user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) is important.  While both fields are related, but require individual practice, study, and thought.  **If you're looking to become a better designer, or just want to know what makes some apps great, understanding UI & UX in depth is essential.**

# What is design?
Before we get into the differences between UI and UX design, it's important to have a grasp on the definition of design.  Most folks would say that design is how to make things look pretty, but my definition is a little more encompassing.

I would argue that design is everything, *literally*.  Hold on, I know that answer is a cop-out, but stay with me.  Design is any structure that is meant to convey a meaning or purpose to someone.  Websites have design, furniture has design, software has design, and even [languages have design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban).

In this story, we're mostly concerned with **visual design**, a subset that explores human sight, perception, and psychology.  Product design, web design, graphic design, and interior design are all examples of visual design.  As it so happens, UI & UX are included on that list.

## What is UI and UX Design?
User interface (UI) design includes topics like colors, typography, and spacing.  This is the "pretty" part.

User experience (UX) design is the way our product functions.  UX helps us guide users in various tasks such as signing up for a newsletter or navigating to a specific page.  

In this story, we're focusing on traditional applications of UI/UX design, like desktop applications or websites.  However, UI/UX isn't limited to this space and can be applied to almost anything.

# In-depth: User Interface
User interface (UI) design is the application of design rules to interactive or informational elements.  User interface defines how an app looks through usage of colors, spacing, typography, and much more.  There's a few key reasons why UI design is so important.

1. It helps users know what to look at first

If you've ever read a newspaper or magazine, you know they contain lots of words, images, and even advertisements.  What you might not realize is how much work goes into the hierarchy design.

2. It helps users easily find and read information

3. It helps users understand what to tap or click

There is much, much more to UI design, and it deserves it's own story - but hopefully these examples give you a good idea on what user interface design entails.
